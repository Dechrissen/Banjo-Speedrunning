    <p id="caption">All these assume flat ground, when you apply up and downhill slopes some properties may change. For instance, your XZ speed will decrease if you go up slopes, but increase as you go down slopes. Going uphills you want to slide as little as possible and going downhills you want to slide as much as possible (sometimes may even be worth reaching the end of the slide to just stay walking downhill depending on the length and steepness of the slope). This concept applies to all forms of ground movement for all transformations and shoes.</p>
