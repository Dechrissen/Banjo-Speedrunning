------------------------------------

[1.2] 2021-02-15

Added:

- Bingo-Toolie web companion (new URL is /bt/bingo-toolie).
- Bingo-Toolie 'How to use' blurb.
- Feature: trick linking. You can now link specific tricks in URLs (e.g. /bk/levels/rbb#Boom_Box_Quick_Kill will link to the RBB page and scroll the linked trick into view).
- BT bingo redirect page (/bt/bingo).
- BK category extensions redirect page (/bk/category-extensions).
- BT category extensions redirect page (/bt/category-extensions).
- BK bitclips guide (/bk/bitclips).
- Dark(er) theme.
- Endpoints for version changelogs (like this one) (e.g. /updates/1.2 for version 1.2 notes). Current version changelog will now be clickable in footer sitewide.
- New font for headings (CCComicrazy).

Changed:

- Changes to URL nomenclature for consistency:
  - /bklevels/ttc --> /bk/levels/ttc
  - /bkcategories/100 --> /bk/categories/100
  - /btversions --> /bt/versions
  - etc.
- Reorganized homepage, removed BP/GR/N&B panels until they are needed.
- Better responsive design for most mobile phones (not perfect, but a lot better than v1.1).
- Style changes (headings, fonts, links, colors, etc.).

Fixed:

- Compressed GIFs and converted to MP4s for faster load times with the pages that use them (thanks, wed).
- Fixed some broken video embeds.
