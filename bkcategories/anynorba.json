	"description": "This category involves beating grunty as fast as possible without the use of RBA (reverse bee adventure). Sandcastle cheats are not allowed. In this category you go through every level as BK and collect notes and jiggies along the way. Token count is very lenient due to only needing the pumpkin. The only big tricks this category does is FP early and DoG skip, so it's definitely a lot easier than normal any%l.",
