	"description": "This category involves collecting everything on the totals screen in order to get 100%. This includes all the notes, jiggies, and honeycombs in the game. All mumbo tokens are NOT required as they arent on the totals screen. The use of sandcastle cheats in this category is prohibited. There are 3 main routes for this category used in RTA speedruns: No RBA, RRBA, and RBA. A description of each route is given in the pastebin below. Most people generally start out with this category as the beginner routes dont usually include big tricks and dont lose that much time to the more advanced routes.",
